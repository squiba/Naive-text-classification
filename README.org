** Requirements
- python3
- sklearn (machine learning models)
- [[https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/persistence.html][joblib]] ( save the models on disk)

See [[text-classification.ipynb]] for a classification using Naive Bayes.
- Performance of various classifiers [[performance.png]]
Note: Hyper-parameters are not tuned for any of the models. Moreover accuracy depends on type of features selected,
train-test set partition overfitting etc.
- all the features ( more than 1000K) were taken for all models, As expected KNN performed very poorly.
